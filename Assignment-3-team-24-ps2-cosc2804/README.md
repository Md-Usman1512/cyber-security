INSTRUCTIONS FOR PATCHING MCPI API:
- Navigate to the mcpi API install folder (Typically on Windows machines: `C:\Users\<USER>\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python39\Lib\site-packages\mcpi`)
    * I recommend making a backup of the `connection.py` file found here before replacing
- replace the `connection.py` file with the modded `connection.py` file found in this repository

INSTRUCTIONS FOR PATCHING RASPBERRYJUICE:
- Navigate to the Spigot server's plugin folder
    * I again recommend making a backup of the `raspberryjuice-1.12.1.jar` found here before replacing
- Replace the `raspberryjuice-1.12.1.jar` file with the `raspberryjuice-1.12.1.jar` file found in this repository
